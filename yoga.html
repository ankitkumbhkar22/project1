    <h1>WHAT IS YOGA ?</h1>
    <P> Yoga is an ancient practice that involves physical poses, concentration, and deep breathing. A regular yoga practice can promote endurance, strength, calmness, flexibility, and well-being. Yoga is now a popular form of exercise around the world.</P>
    <h1>WHY YOGA IS IMPORTANT  </h1>
    <P>Yoga improves strength, balance and flexibility.
        Slow movements and deep breathing increase blood flow and warm up muscles, while holding a pose can build strength. Balance on one foot, while holding the other foot to your calf or above the knee (but never on the knee) at a right angle.
    </P>
    <h1>WHY YOGA IS GOOD</h1>
    <P>Mindful yoga can help to improve mental health by reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions. The practice encourages self-awareness and acceptance, which can lead to a greater sense of well-being and improved mood.

    </P>
